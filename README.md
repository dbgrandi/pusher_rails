[Pusher](https://pusher.com) for Rails 3.1+
=====================

Adds:
- [pusher-gem v0.8.4](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-gem/tree/v0.8.4)
- [pusher.js v1.11.0](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js/tree/v1.11.0)
- [backpusher.js](https://github.com/pusher/backpusher/commit/e61c9d7a761fcb48f312416408d1bf4ed418735b#diff-1)

This pulls in the *pusher-gem* as well as adding *pusher.js* and *backpusher.js* to the assets pipeline of your Rails 3.1+ app.

Add this to your app/assets/javascripts/application.js:

    // if you want to use pusher.js
    //= require pusher

    // if you are using pusher.js + backbone.js
    //= require backpusher
